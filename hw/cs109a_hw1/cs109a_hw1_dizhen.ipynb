    "## Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, your goal is to learn how to acquire, parse, clean, and analyze data. Toward this goal, we will address certain questions about COVID, and you will scrape data directly from a website. For the remainder of the semester, we will provide you data files directly; however, since real-world problems often require gathering information from a variety of sources, including the Internet, web scraping is a highly useful skill to have.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "- To submit your assignment, follow the instructions given in Canvas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Get started using [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), which are incredibly popular, powerful, and will be our medium of programming for the duration of CS109A and CS109B.\n",
    "- Become familiar with how to access and use data from various sources (i.e., web scraping and directly from files).\n",
    "- Gain experience with data exploration and simple analysis.\n",
    "- Become comfortable with [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) as a means of storing and working with data.\n",
    "- Reflect on what further analysis you may wish to do with this data. For example, given the material we've covered so far, what *more* do you wish you had the ability to do (e.g., modelling, prediction, etc). That is, think about questions you may have about the data, and try to imagine what types of tools you might need to help answer your questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "- Exercise **responsible scraping**. Web servers can become slow or unresponsive if they receive too many requests from the same source in a short amount of time. In your code, use a delay of 2 seconds between requests. This helps to not get blocked by the target website -- imagine how frustrating it would be to have this occur. Section 1 of this homework involves saving the scraped web pages to your local machine. Thus, after completing Section 1, you do not need to re-scrape any of the pages, unless you wish to occasionally grab the latest data. \n",
    "\n",
    "- <span style='color:purple'>**Web scraping requests can take several minutes**</span>. This is another reason why you should not wait until the last minute to do this homework.\n",
    "- As you run a Jupyter Notebook, it maintains a running state of memory. Thus, <span style='color:purple'>the order in which you run cells matters</span> and plays a crucial role; it can be easy to make mistakes based on *when* you run different cells as you develop and test your code. Before submitting every Jupyter Notebook homework assignment, be sure to restart your Jupyter Notebook and run the entire notebook from scratch, all at once (i.e., \"Kernel -> Restart & Run All\"). Just make sure to not re-run the time intensive tasks unnecessarily. In this notebook for example, you could declare a variable to act as a 'setting' and use some controll logic to prevent a re-scrap from happening when not desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will be working with COVID data. COVID has impacted everyone in the world, and naturally some people have been greatly more affected than others. We, the teaching staff, are sensitive to this, empathize, and understand that working with COVID data may be unsettling to some. We apologize for any discomfort this may cause. Our intent with this assignment is purely pedagogical, and we'd like to remind students that data science and machine learning can be used to provide insights that can be used for good and invoke change. Toward this goal, parts of the homework are intended to shed light on the unfortunate, widespread inequality that exists. So, while this data may be unsettling, our aim is for the learned skills addressed here -- and in all future assignments -- to provide you with knowledge and confidence to do good work."

    "## 1. Obtaining Data (17 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "For any given situation or scenario that we wish to understand, we will rely on having relevant data. Here, we are interested in the degree to which the SARS-CoV-2 virus has affected United States citizens (SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes the COVID-19 disease). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides relevant data from USAFacts.org that includes the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases on a per-county basis. Visit https://usafacts.org/visualizations/coronavirus-covid-19-spread-map/. At the bottom of the web page, in a blue table, you should see a list of every state, each of which has its own web page.\n",

    "These are highly alarming and tragic statistics, and doing calculations like this can really put the severity of the virus into a grounded perspective. In order to perfectly understand the virus and its spread, everyone would be tested and we would have contact tracing. Without getting into socio-political issues, our point is that (1) we wish to better understand the virus' effects; (2) naturally, any real-world data is messy, and thus we will never have _perfect_ data.\n",

    "Let's now attempt to understand _some_ of the uncertainty around our COVID data. It's reasonable to believe that the # of COVID deaths is fairly reliable. That is, there are inevitably some false negatives -- people who died of COVID but were not accounted for, as other conditions were listed as the cause. However, the number of false positives is probably minimal -- if someone was denoted as dying from COVID, it's probably true. It's also the case that every disease has a mortality rate. For example, if 1,000 randomly-selected people contracted COVID, $N\\%$ of them will die. We'd imagine that this percentage should be pretty constant throughout all people in the United States. Of course, we can think of reasons for this rate to not be perfectly consistent, as some people are at higher risk (e.g., older folks, people with pre-existing conditions, etc). Yet, we can imagine that this natural *variance* in the population to be fairly uniform throughout the USA at large. To this end, if all counties were equal in their **testing**, we ought to see a consistent ratio between: (a) the # of people who died from COVID; and (b) the # of people who tested positive for COVID. Within the medical domain, this ratio is referred to as the `case_fatality_rate`. For example, if 750 people tested positive for COVID, and 75 of those people died, then our `case_fatality_rate` would be 0.1 (meaning 10%)."

Also, while we will still keep the same columns (i.e, features), the values of each should now represent the __average__ value of all rows that were subsumed in the making of the aggregate income-group. Your resulting DataFrame should have just 4 rows (income-group-1, income-group-2, income-group-3, income-group-4). See example in the cell below.\n",

Many counties are being aggregated for each income-group row. This approach isn't as accurate as possible; it would be more accurate if we re-adjusted every value so that it was truly an average that was based on the total __population__ of all counties that are subsumed within a given income-group row. That's okay, though. An average of averages will suffice for the purpose of this exercise. \n",

To this end, we encourage you to reflect on your progress, strengths, and weaknesses and to make changes, if necessary, to accomplish your goals. Likewise, please reach out to the TFs and teaching staff if you need help. We want everyone to feel comfortable in being honest about these elements, with both herself/himself and us. For these purposes, we will ask you several times throughout the semester to complete an anonymous poll."
